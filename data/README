# ProBE Pre-Processing

**ProBE_pre_processing** downloads a large rectangle from swissalti3d and the cantonal boundaries from swissboundaries. It downloads 2m tiles (COG), converts to 5m by averaging and clips to the polygon boundaries with a buffer of 5000m.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Raw DEM Data:** 2m DEM from SwissALTI3D
*   **BE Boundary Data:** SwissBOUNDARIES
*   **Downsampling:** 2m to 5m by averaging. Ensuring grid snaps to 5m values.
*   **Buffer:** 5km buffer around BE Polygon to ensure capturing landslides coming into BE from outsides.
